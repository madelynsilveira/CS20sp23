    <h2> Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ): </h2>
    <h3> What should I expect at the first lesson?</h3>
    <p>For the first lesson, students should arrive at the rink at least 15 minutes early. Make sure to check in with the Coordinator. You will typically find them inside the front door of the rink holding a clipboard. Be sure your child has the right equipment and clothes (see Skates, Helmets & Clothes below).</p>
    <h3>How long is a Lesson?</h3>
    <p>Students are on the ice a total of 50 minutes. There is a 25-minute lesson and a 25-minute supervised practice. We encourage all parents to be supportive and enthusiastic. Watching your child skate is welcome and encouraged. Please make sure to stand back several feet from the ice surface and barrier so as not to distract students and Instructors during class time.</p>
    <h3>What equipment will my child need?</h3>
    <p>Single-blade, sharpened skates and a helmet are mandatory. Warm, comfortable clothes are recommended. We do not provide equipment, although skates may be available for rent at the rink office.</p>
    <h3>Can I make up a class if I miss one?</h3>
    <p>No. There are no makeup lessons or transfers to other classes.</p>
    <h3>Can I get a refund?</h3>
    <p>BEFORE THE FIRST LESSON – If you cancel your entire registration BEFORE the first lesson, we call it a cancellation. You must Contact Us in the office on a business day before the day of the first lesson. Your payment will be refunded minus a $25 transaction fee for processing your cancellation.

<br>AFTER ONE LESSON – We understand that sometimes it becomes clear after the first lesson that skating classes might not be a good fit for your child at this time. If you notify the office within three (3) business days of the first lesson, you will be refunded the amount of the remaining lessons in your package.

<br>AFTER TWO LESSONS – There are no refunds after two lessons. There are no makeup lessons or transfers to other classes.</p>
    <h3>How do I know if class is cancelled due to bad weather?</h3>
    <p>Classes are cancelled only when the rink is closed, which does not happen often. In the event of bad weather, you will be notified of storm cancellations through the email address you used during registration.</p>
