    <ol>
    <li>Name one thing you like about using github and one about using cpanel hosting. 
      I like using github because it allows me to edit and observe all in one place. It feels very intuitive.
      I like c-panel hosting because it feels like an official website.</li>
    <li>What was the most satisfying part of this assignment?
      It took me an embarrassing amount of time to get the image to be the right size so it was very satisfying when it looked just right. </li>
