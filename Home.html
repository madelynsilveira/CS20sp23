  <h2>Get Aquainted with Bay State Skating School</h2>

  <br><br>
  <h2 style="background-color:Gainsboro;background-size:auto 80px;"> Our Story </h2>
  <p>Fifty years ago, parents expressed the wish that every child should learn at least the basics of swimming and ice skating. Swimming lessons in those days were widely available, but not the case with ice skating instruction. PTA parents enlisted Rosemary Hanley Cloran and Carol Butterworth McKinnon, both former competitive skaters to teach students in an after-school program. Rosemary and Carol began the Bay State Skating School to meet the need for skating instruction as an afternoon activity. As the years progressed, the demand for Learn to Skate programs became widespread. In the sixties, MDC, (Metropolitan District Commission), inspired by Bobby Orr, built rinks in many communities in the greater Boston area. Rosemary and Carol brought their programs to many of those rinks. In the beginning, they taught all the classes themselves. Soon they needed additional instructors.</p>
  <p> Over the years, recreation departments in cities and towns also enlisted the Bay State Skating School to offer lessons. Over seventy five thousand students have learned to skate through the Bay State Skating School. Many families have had 3 generations who have learned to skate with our instructors. <br>In 2001, Carol retired. Rosemary has continued as director, as the interest in skating continues to grow. The Bay State Skating School is a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting ice skating skills and fun on ice. Ice skating develops balance, strength, confidence, recreational and social skills, and in many cases offers a lifelong activity.</p>

  <h4>Benefits of Ice Skating:</h4>
    <p>Ice skating develops balance, strength, confidence, recreational and social skills, and in many cases offers a lifelong activity. It improves posture, balance, flexibility and coordination and enhances muscle strength and endurance. But the benefits of ice skating extend beyond physical fitness. It teaches kids goal setting and the pursuit of excellence, and it gives children a higher level of self-esteem and a more positive outlook on life.</p><br>
  <p>Our school is a NON-PROFIT Organization dedicated to teaching ice skating skills while having fun. Classes are held at 10 Rinks throughout Greater Boston, North, South and West of the City for children ages 4 through 18. Learn to Skate and have fun!</p>
